At Upsilon Workshop, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
Policy explains our privacy practices for the Upsilon Workshop website and
services (the "Service"). It describes the ways your personal information and
data is collected and used through our designated websites, and the options
available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can
access and update this information.

In short, we don't use your data for anything other than providing you the
Service. We don't sell your data to third parties, and we don't use your data
for advertising, we don't use your data for analytics.
Everything is pruned after 3 months at the maximum.

## Preface

This document is a legal agreement between you and Upsilon Workshop. It
describes the terms and conditions under which you are allowed to use the
Upsilon Workshop website and services. If you do not agree to the terms and
conditions of this agreement, you are not allowed to use the Upsilon Workshop
website and services.

## Definitions

- "Upsilon Workshop" refers to the every service provided by Upsilon Workshop,
  including the website and the API

## Privacy Policy

### Information Collection and Use

Upsilon Workshop collects personal information when you register for an Upsilon
Workshop account (email address, username and hashed password). Upsilon Workshop
uses this information to provide you with the Service, and to contact you about
the services on our site in which you have expressed interest, or to send you
notifications about the Service (for example, when you are not respecting
the Terms of Service). Upsilon Workshop does not sell or rent your personal
information to third parties. This information is only used to provide you the
Service and is not used for any other purpose.

Upsilon Workshop automatically receives and records information on our server
logs from your browser, including your IP address, your user agent, and the
pages you request. This data is only used in the server's logs and is not used
for any other purpose. For example, we do not use your IP address to track your
behavior on the website. This data can be used to help diagnose problems with
our servers, to administer the Service, and to gather broad demographic
information.

### Cookies

Upsilon Workshop does not use cookies, but we use localStorage to store your
preferences, so this is a kind of cookie.

List of cookies:

| Name                    | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `token`                 | This is the token used to authenticate you on the API.                                     |
| `dontShowDeleteConfirm` | This is used to know if you want to show the delete confirmation when you delete a script. |

We plan to allow you to fully disable cookies in the future while still having
almost the same experience as with cookies enabled (by storing the data in the
RAM instead of in the localStorage).

### Analytics

Upsilon Workshop does not use any analytics tool.

### Third Party Services

The only third-party service we use is the Google Fonts API, which is used to
load the fonts used on the website. You can find the privacy policy of the
Google Fonts API at [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Data Deletion

Upsilon Workshop will retain your information for as long as your account is
active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account,
you can do so by going to the settings page and clicking on the
"Delete account". See the "Data Retention" section for more information about
the data retention.

### Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information

To review and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate, you
can do so by going to the settings page and editing your information. If an
information is not editable, you can contact us at the email address given in
the Terms of Service.

Some information can't be edited due to technical limitations. For example, you
can't change your username since it is used to identify you on the API
(primary key of the database and used in relations with other tables).
In the future, we plan to allow you to change your username, but this will
require big changes in the database and in the API, so it will take some time.

### Data Retention

Upsilon Workshop will retain your information for as long as your account is
active or as needed to provide you services.

Here is the explanation of the data retention:

- Encrypted dumps of the database are made every hour and are kept for 1 month,
  on the same server as the database. During this time, the dumps are also
  synced to two other places (my personal computer and my phone) and are
  encrypted with a password, in addition to the GPG encryption of the dumps.
  These dumps are removed 1 month after the deletion from the server, so they
  are kept for 2 months in total.
- In addition to the database dump, a snapshot of the disk is made every day and
  are stored encrypted on another server. The last 14 snapshots are kept, so
  they are kept for 2 weeks at the maximum
- The logs of the server are kept for 2 months.

So, old data from the database is removed after 2 months.
Logs are deleted after 2 months and 2 weeks, since they are included in the
snapshots.

We reserve the right to keep the data for a longer period of time if we believe
it is necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, if required by law, or for
legitimate purposes, such as the analysis of non-personally-identifiable data,
or if we are required to do so by law. All retained data will remain subject to
the terms of this Privacy Policy.
The data can be keept for 2 weeks more at the maximum, in case of a server
failure or any other problem. After this time, the data will be deleted
definitely, if it is technically possible.

### Data Portability

You can request a copy of your personal data by contacting us at the email
address given in the Terms of Service. The archive will be created manually and
will be sent to you by email (encrypted with GPG if you have a public key).

Please don't abuse this feature, since it is a manual process. We reserve the
right to limit the number of times you can request your data to one request per
month..

### Requesting Data Removal

If you want your data to be removed before the data retention period, you can
request it by contacting us at the email address given in the Terms of Service.
We will remove your data as soon as possible, but it can take up to 1 week.
Some backups can be kept offline for 2 weeks more, in case of a server failure
or any other problem. After this time, the data will be deleted.
